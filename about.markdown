# Hi, Iâ€™m Sam ðŸ‘‹  

I have a background in **computer science** and experience working in **financial services** as a **Manual Tester/User Acceptance**.  
These days, Iâ€™m focused on breaking into **data science** and exploring ways to combine tech, business, and creativity.  

I enjoy learning quickly, solving problems, and connecting with people. When Iâ€™m not working on tech projects, youâ€™ll probably find me experimenting with new recipes, live streaming, or dialed into a good podcast.  

### What Iâ€™m working on
- Building projects to strengthen my **data science skills**  
- Creating content around **tech + productivity**  
- Exploring **sales engineering** as an opportunity to leverage testing and customer support skills
